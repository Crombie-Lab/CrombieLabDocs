# Protocol Name

This is a template Markdown file for protocols hosted and developed by the Zamanian Lab. To use this template, follow these instructions:

1. Copy the `protocol_name` folder to the location of your choice.

2. Rename the `protocol_name` directory and the `protocol_name.md` file.

3. If you have images, convert them to .png format and save them in the `protocol_name/img/` directory.

## Writing protocols

Use this Markdown file as a template, keeping a few things in mind:

- The title (header 1, denoted by a single `#`) should be in title case.

- All subsequent headings (e.g, `##`, `###`) should be written in sentence case.

- All steps should be written in complete sentences with periods at the end of numeric/bulleted steps.

- Use Î¼L instead of uL.

- Use s., min., and hr. for seconds, minutes, and hours.

## Markdown basics

### Text formatting

*This* and _this_ will italicize words, while **this** and __this__ will embolden them. Or you can do ***both***!

### Line spacing

Two spaces at the end of the line will create a new line.   
Like this.

A blank line in between sentences will create a new paragraph.

Like this.

### Links

All links use the same syntax. For internal links, put the [text](../../docs/protocols/celegans/chemotaxis/chemotaxis.md) you want to print in between square brackets (`[]`) and put the relative path in between parentheses. For example:

`[text](../../docs/protocols/celegans/chemotaxis/chemotaxis.md`

Use the same format for a web [link](zamanianlab.org/ZamanianLabDocs/). For example:

`[link](zamanianlab.org/ZamanianLabDocs/)`

For images, do the same thing but add a `!` before the square brackets. For example:

`![Image](img/test.png)`

![Image](img/test.png)

Images should always be in the `img` directory of the protocol directory.

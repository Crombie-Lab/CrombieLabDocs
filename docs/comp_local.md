# Local OS X Environment

For the most part, the Zamanian lab requires use of macOS on personal computers. The following is a guide for setting up one's local machine for in order to unify machines across the lab.

1. Update your macOS version to Catalina (v10.15.1)

2. Install core software:

    - [Adobe products](https://kb.wisc.edu/69772)
    - [Box Drive](https://www.box.com/resources/downloads/drive) (cloud-based shared file storage)
    - [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) (SFTP client)
    - [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/) (feature-rich terminal replacement)
    - [Atom](https://atom.io/) (Versatile GitHub-owned IDE)
      - Feel free to install this [list of useful packages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zamanianlab/ZamanianLabDocs/master/resources/atom-package-list.txt) using the command `apm install --packages-file {path}/package-list.txt`. The packages in this list will allow you to select text by column using the ‚å• key, "beautify" text and code according to universal syntax rules, highlight all occurrences of a selection, and preview the HTML version of .md files, among others. You can also browse and install [Atom themes](https://atom.io/themes).
    - [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) (IDE for R scripting and plotting)
    - [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (lightweight text editor)
    - [Slack](<http://www.slack.com>) (primary lab communication tool)
    - [UW VPN](https://kb.wisc.edu/helpdesk/page.php?id=90370) (VPN for off-campus resource access)
    - [Zoom](https://zoom.us/download) (video meeting software)
    - [Paperpile](https://paperpile.com/) (reference management)


3. Install additional bioinformatics and imaging software:

    - [Fiji](https://fiji.sc/) (primary software used for image analysis)
    - [FigTree](https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/releases) (graphical viewer of phylogenetic trees)
    - [ClustalX](http://www.clustal.org/download/current/) (GUI-based sequence aligner)
    - [4Peaks](https://nucleobytes.com/4peaks/index.html) (editing of sequence trace files)


4. Replace your `~/.bash_profile` with the lab `.bash_profile` found in the `resources` directory of the GitHub repo that hosts this site (direct link: [.bash_profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zamanianlab/ZamanianLabDocs/master/resources/.bash_profile)).

5. Create your R environment:

    - Use [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/) to install or update R to version 3.6.2
    - Install the [ZamanianLabREnvironment](https://github.com/wheelern/ZamanianLabREnvironment) R package to create a consistent environment across machines.


6. Create your Python environment:

    - Install [miniconda3](comp_conda.md)

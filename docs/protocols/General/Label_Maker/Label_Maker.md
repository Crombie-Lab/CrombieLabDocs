# Printing Labels using the Dymo LabelWriter 450

**Note:** Follow the [Lab Manual](../../../labmanual.md) labeling schemes and labeling order for different stocks (plasmids, bacteria, worm strains).

## Loading Labels

- Open the top cover of the label machine and remove the label spool from inside the cover and separate the spool guide from the spindle.

- Place the label roll on the spindle so that the labels feed from underneath and the left edge of the label roll is firmly against the side of the spool. Slide the spool guide onto the right side of the spool and press the guide tightly against the side of the label roll.

- Insert the label spool into the slot within the label maker. Align the left edge of the label with the left edge of the label feed slot and insert the label into the slot. Slide the label guide to the left until the label guide aligns with the right edge of the label. Close the lid

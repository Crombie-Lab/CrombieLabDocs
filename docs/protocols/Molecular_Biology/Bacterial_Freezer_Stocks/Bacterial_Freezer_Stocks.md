# Preparation of Bacterial Freezer Stocks

1. Pipette 5-10 mL LB (with appropriate antibiotic) into 15mL tube. For instructions on preparing LB broth, refer to [Zamanian Lab Recipes](../General_Recipes/General_Recipes.md).

2. Inoculate a single colony from the streak or transformation plate.

3. Shake the tube at 37°C overnight.

4. After ~16 hours, take culture tubes out of the incubator and make freezer stocks as directed below.

5. Label 3 cryogenic tubes appropriately (plasmid name, competent bacteria used, and date) with a printed label.

6. Add 500 μl of sterile 50% glycerol and an equal volume of culture to each cryo tube.

7. Place 2 tubes in the correct Bacterial Stock box in -80°C and 1 tube in the liquid N<sub>2</sub> tank.

8. Inventory freezer stocks in Quartzy.

*See [Lab Manual](../../../labmanual.md) for complete tube labeling and Quartzy inventory instructions.*

# Preparation of Bacterial Freezer Stocks

## Materials

- LB broth
- Cryogenic tubes
- 50% glycerol (autoclaved)

## Protocol

1. Pipette 5-10 mL LB (with appropriate antibiotic) into 15mL tube. For instructions on preparing LB broth, refer to [Zamanian Lab Recipes](../General_Recipes/General_Recipes.md).

2. Inoculate a single colony from the streak or transformation plate.

3. Set tube to shake in 37°C incubator overnight.

4. After ~16 hours, take culture tubes out of the incubator and make freezer stocks as directed below.

5. Label cryogenic tubes appropriately with a printed label.

6. Add 500 μl of sterile 50% glycerol and an equal volume of culture to each cryo tube.

7. Place tubes in correct -80°C and liquid N<sub>2</sub> Bacterial Stock.

8. Inventory freezer stocks in Quartzy.

*See [Lab Manual](../../../labmanual.md) for complete tube labeling, tube count, and Quartzy inventory instructions.*

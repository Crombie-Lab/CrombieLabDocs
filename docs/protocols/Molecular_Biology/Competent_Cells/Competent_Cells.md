# Preparation of Chemically Competent Cells

This protocol involves steps occurring over multiple days. Prepare accordingly.

## Materials

- TSS Buffer (see recipe below)
- LB broth
- Bacterial stock (ex. DH5-α)
- 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes


## Protocol

### Day 1

1. Streak bacteria from a glycerol stock on an LB agar plate and incubate the plate at 37°C overnight.

### Day 2

2. Inoculate a 5 mL LB broth culture (no antibiotic) using a single colony from the plate in step 1. Incubate the culture overnight at 37°C.

3. Prepare TSS buffer using the following recipe:

  | Reagent | Amount |
  | ------- | ------ |
  | PEG 8000 (or 3350) | 5 g |
  | MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1M <sup>1</sup> | 1.5 mL |
  | DMSO | 2.5 mL |
  | LB Broth | up to 50 mL |

 <sup>1</sup> 0.3 g MgCl<sub>2</sub>*H<sub>2</sub>O can be used in place of the 1M MgCl<sub>2</sub> solution.

4. Filter the TSS buffer through a 0.22 μm filter and store at 4°C.

### Day 3

5. Dilute the culture 1:100 by inoculating four 50 mL conical tubes with 50 mL LB broth and 500 μL of overnight bacterial culture. Grow the cultures at 37°C until the OD<sub>600</sub> is between 0.2 and 0.5.

6. Chill the culture, 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and TSS on ice 10 min. Meanwhile, cool the centrifuge to 4°C for the next step.

7. Pellet the bacterial cells at >3000 RCF for 10 min at 4°C.

  **Important:** The cells must remain on ice and stay cold from this point forward in order to maintain a high transformation efficiency.

8. Remove the supernatant and resuspend in 10% volume chilled TSS buffer (ex. resuspend a 50 mL culture in 5 mL TSS buffer)

9. Aliquot 100 μL cells in TSS buffer into the chilled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.

10. Flash freeze the aliquots in liquid N<sub>2</sub> and store at -80°C.

The transformation efficiency should be tested for every new batch of chemically competent cells.

# Total Parasite RNA to cDNA Synthesis

**General Note**: Thermo Fisher Scientific SuperScript™ III First-Strand Synthesis System will be used and followed to generate cDNA from total parasite RNA. A description of this protocol is below.

## Methods

1. Mix and centrifuge each component of the SuperScript III kit (-20°C Stag-moose).

2. Combine the following reaction in a 0.2 mL PCR tube. For cloning, maximize the total RNA input (8 µL). For qPCR, standardize total RNA input across samples if possible.

    | Component | Volume |
    |--------------|---------|
    |Total Parasite RNA | *n* µL |
    |Oligo dT   |1 µL |
    |Random Hexamer| 1 µL |
    |10 mM dNTP mix| 1 µL |
    |Molecular Grade H<sub>2</sub>O| to 10 µL |

3. Incubate the tube at 65ºC for 5 minutes, then place on ice for at least 1 min.

4. Prepare the following cDNA Synthesis Mix, adding each component in the indicated order. Synthesis Mix is enough for one reaction (scale accordingly).

    |  Component | Volume |
    |--------------|---------|
    |10X RT Buffer | 2 µL |
    |25 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>  |4 µL |
    |0.1 M DTT| 2 µL |
    |RNaseOUT (40 U/µL)| 1 µL |
    |SuperScript III RT (200 U/µL)| 1 µL |
    |**TOTAL** |10 µL|

5. Add 10 µL of cDNA Synthesis Mix to each RNA/primer mix, mix gently, collect by centrifugation and incubate for 10 min. at 25°C, followed by 50 min. at 50°C.

6. Terminate the reactions at 85°C for 5 min. Chill on ice.

7. Collect reactions by brief centrifugation. Add 1 µL of RNase H to each tube and incubate the tubes for 20 min. at 37°C.  

8. Final cDNA product can be stored at -20°C or used immediately.

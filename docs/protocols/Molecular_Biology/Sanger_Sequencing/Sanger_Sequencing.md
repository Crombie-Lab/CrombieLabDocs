# Sanger Sequencing

**Note:** Adjust the amount of DNA that is added according to the template: plasmid = 100-200 ng for <20 kb plasmid; PCR product = 5-10 ng per 100 bp.

See the [Biotech Center website](https://www.biotech.wisc.edu/services/dnaseq/services/sanger-sequencing) for pricing and further guidelines.

## Materials

- BigDye
- BigDye 5X Buffer
  - BigDye and buffer can be purchased from the Biotech Center; ring the doorbell in room 1259 or email <dnaseq@biotech.wisc.edu>
- Gene specific primers (10 µM)
- Nuclease-free water
- CleanSEQ beads (Beckman Coulter #A29151)
- 80% ethanol
- 96-well magnet (Kathy's bench)

## Protocol

### BigDye Sequencing Reaction

1. In a PCR strip tube, add the following:

    | Reagent | Volume |
    |---------|--------|
    | 5X buffer | 3 µL |
    | BigDye  | 2 µL   |
    | Primer  | 1 µL   |
    | DNA     | x µL (see note above) |
    | Water   | to 20 µL |
    |**Total** | 20 µL   |

    **Note:** If a problem arises during sequencing, it is very likely that two primers were inadvertently used instead of 1. A PCR takes 2 primers but a sequencing reaction only takes 1, so you will have 2X as many reactions if you plan to sequence in both directions.

2. Run the following thermocycler program:

    | Temperature | Time | Cycles |
    |-------------|------|--------|
    | 96°C        | 3 min | NA    |
    | 96°C <br> 52°C <br> 60°C | 15 s <br> 15 s <br> 3 min | <br> 35 |
    | 72°C        | 1 min | NA    |
    | 4°C         | Store |       |

### CleanSEQ Magnetic Bead Clean-Up

1. Shake beads to mix and aliquot in a single tube 10 µL of beads per 20 µL reaction (plus 10% overage)

2. Add 80 µL of cold 80% ethanol

3. Mix by pipetting

4. Place tube(s) in magnet

5. Wait 30 s or until the beads have congregated on the side of each tube

6. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant without disturbing the beads

7. Add 200 µL of 80% ethanol

8. Repeat steps 3-6

9. Remove the tubes from the magnet and air dry the beads for 5 min

10. Add 50 µL water, pipette to mix

11. Samples can be stored at 4°C until submission

### Submitting Samples

1. Ensure that the strip tube(s) are properly labeled; place the tubes in a plastic baggie or wrap in foil and label with PI name, your name, and date

2. Take samples to the Biotech Center at 425 Henry Mall (no need for ice)

3. Place tube(s) in the mini-fridge in room 1259

4. Login to the computer with your NetID

5. Fill out the submission form and print 2 copies

6. Place one copy in the correct cubby above the freezer and place the other copy on Kathy's desk

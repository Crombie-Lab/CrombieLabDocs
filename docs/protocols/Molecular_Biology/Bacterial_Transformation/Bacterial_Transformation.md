# Transformation of Competent Cells

## Materials

- Water bath warmed to 42°C
- Agar plates with appropriate antibiotic (room temperature)
- SOC media (room temperature)

## Competent Cell Choice

- NEB 5-alpha (NEB, # C2987I) for HiFi Assemblies
- JM109 (Promega, # L2001) for cloning in pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, # A1360)
- DH5-alpha (made in-house) for other purposes (e.g., *C. elegans* Fire Lab plasmids)

**Note:** Follow the kit protocols for commercial cell transformation.

## Protocol (JM109 and DH5-alpha)

1. Take competent cells out of -80°C and thaw on ice.

2. Add 1 - 5 μL of plasmid (usually 10 pg - 100 ng) or ligation mixture into ~100 μL of competent cells in a cold 1.5 mL tube. Gently mix by flicking.

3. Place the competent cell and DNA mixture on ice for 20-30 min.

4. Heat-shock in a 42°C water bath for 30-60 s. (45 s. is best). **Do not shake.**

7. Place on ice for 2 min.

8. Add 900 μL of SOC.

9. Incubate at 37°C with shaking (225 RPM) for 45 min.

10. Plate bacteria on agar plates, typically 3 plates with 100 µL, 200 µL, and 300 µL each. Pipette bacteria onto the plate, add ~10 glass beads, put the lid on the plate and slowly roll the beads through the liquid and around the entire surface area of the plate.

11. Dump used beads into a glass bottle with 100% ethanol for later re-use.

12. Incubate the plates at 37°C overnight.

# Transformation of Competent Cells

## Materials

- Water bath warmed to 42°C
- Agar plates with appropriate antibiotic, cooled to room temperature
- SOC media

## Protocol

1. Take competent cells out of -80°C and thaw on ice.

2. Add 1 - 5 μL of plasmid (usually 10 pg - 100 ng) into ~100 μL of competent cells in a cold 1.5 mL tube. Gently mix by flicking.

3. Place the competent cell and DNA mixture on ice for 20-30 min.

4. Heat-shock mixture by placing the bottom 1/2 to 2/3 of the tube into a 42°C water bath for 30-60 s. (45 s. is probably best).

7. Place on ice for 2 min.

8. Add 900 μL of SOC.

9. Incubate at 37°C with shaking for 45 min.

10. Plate bacteria on agar plates, typically 3 plates with 100 uL, 200 uL, and 300 uL each. Pipette bacteria onto the plate, add ~10 glass beads, put the lid on the plate and slowly roll the beads through the liquid and around the entire surface area of the plate.

11. Dump used beads into a glass bottle with 100% ethanol for later re-use.

12. Incubate the plates at 37°C overnight.

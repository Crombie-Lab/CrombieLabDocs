# Infecting Mosquitoes via Blood Feeding with Microfilariae

**General note:** remove the sucrose pads(s) from mosquito cartons 24 hr. prior to feeding mosquitoes

## Prepare blood for feeding

### Starting with infected blood

1. Invert the tube of infected blood to mix the mf

2. Remove 20 μL of infected blood and put it into 50 μL of dH<sub>2</sub>O on a slide

3. After spreading the mix with a pipette tip, place the slide on a compound microscope and count the mf.

    - **NOTE**: be sure to also count any mf that may have squeezed out from under the cover slip

4. Calculate the mf number in the stock solution. Dilute the infected blood to determine how much defibrinated sheep’s blood (<a href="https://hemostat.com/page.php?id=2" target="blank">Hemostat Laboratories DSB100</a>) to add to get the desired blood feeding concentration.

    - **NOTE** The blood feeders hold 10 mL of blood. When calculating final volume use 11 mL for 1 mL overage and multiply this by number of feeders you will need.

5. Re-enumerate the mf in the diluted stock blood in duplicate

    - Appropriate concentrations for blood feeding:

        - *B. pahangi*: 120–160 mf/20 μl  
        - *D. immitis*: 80–160 mf/20 μL

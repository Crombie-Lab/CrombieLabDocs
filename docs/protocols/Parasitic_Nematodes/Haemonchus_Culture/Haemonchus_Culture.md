## Protocols

### Egg purification for larval development assay

1. Weigh out 24 g of fecal matter and homogenize it in 100 mL of 13% NaCl.

2. Filter through 300, 180, 106 and 25 μm stainless steel sieves. Clean eggs will be captured on the 25 μm sieve.

3. Flush the trapped eggs to an edge and use a squirt bottle of water to rinse the eggs into a petri dish.

4. Create a sucrose gradient in a 50 mL conical tube by adding 10 mL of 25% sucrose with 10 mL 10% sucrose layered on top.

5. Carefully transfer the egg solution to the sucrose gradient.

6. Centrifuge the tubes for 7 min. at 650 x g.

7. The eggs will be at the interface of the gradient. Use a pipette to transfer the eggs to the 25 μm sieve and wash with tap water.

8. Rinse the eggs into a 50 mL conical tube (final volume of 25 mL). Add 25 mL of bleach solution and rotate for 12 minutes.

9. Rinse again on the sieve and resuspend eggs in water + Amphotericin B + tylosin tartare (4500 egg/mL).

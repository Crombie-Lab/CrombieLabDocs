# Modified McMaster's technique for fecal egg counting

## Materials
- Wooden tongue depressors
- Sheather's sugar solution (recipe below)
- Tea strainer
- Graduated cylinder
- Glass beaker
- Transfer pipettes
- McMaster slides

## Equipment
- Microscope

## Protocol

1. Weigh out 2 grams feces per sample.

2. Measure out 60 mL of Sheathers Sugar Solution and add enough to cover feces (25 mL should be sufficient).

3. Mix well and strain the mixture through a tea strainer by squeezing feces with spatula to expel the fluid and liberate specimens. Add rest of the sugar solution to the filtrate.

4. While stirring, draw up suspension in transfer pipet and transfer to both chambers of McMaster slide (be sure not to get bubbles under the grid region).

5. Let slide sit 5-15 minutes for eggs to float.

6. Count total number of eggs under both grids.

7. Multiply the number counted by 100 to get the number of eggs per gram (EPG) of feces (2 grams / 60 mL * 0.3 mL under two grids = 1/100 final dilution).

## Recipe for Sheather's sugar solution

1. Combine 454 g granulated sugar and 355 mL water.

2. Heat while stirring until dissolved (preferably in a double boiler).

3. Add 6 mL of 37% formaldehyde or formalin.

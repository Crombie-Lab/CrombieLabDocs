# Filarial Parasite Culture

Carry out all work in sterile BSC environment and use sterile technique.

## Materials
- RPMI-1640 (Sigma R8758)   
- Pen-Strep 10,000U/mL (Thermo 15140122)  
- Gentamicin 0.4 mg/µL (Sigma G1272-100ML)  
- FBS (Thermo 16000044)


### ***Brugia spp.*** parasites (mf, L3, Adults)

*Note:* Make culture media and scale volume as needed. Media can be stored at 4°C for 1 month. Parasites will typically arrive in 50 mL conical tubes. Culture adult parasites for at least 24 hours prior to downstream use.

  | Culture Media Component    | Volume (for 50 mL total)               |
  |----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
  |RPMI-1640                   |44 mL                                   |
  |Pen-Strep (100 U/mL each)   |500 μL of 100X stock (10,000 U/mL each) |
  |Gentamicin (4 μg/μL)        |500 uL of 100X stock (0.4 mg/μL)        |
  |FBS (10% v/v)               |5 mL                                    |

Pre-heat RPMI-1640 for 30 min at 37°C. Thaw FBS, Pen-Strep and Gentamicin at room temperature.

1. Pellet parasites

  - To pellet mf, spin in benchtop centrifuge (2,000 x g) for 10 min.

  - To pellet L3 or adults, let settle for 30 min. at room temperature in BSC.

2. Remove nearly all of the shipping media.

3. Transfer remaining volume containing the parasites into a new conical tube. Add fresh culture media to tubes (10 mL of media to 15 mL conical; 30 mL of media to 50 mL conical).

  - Use 15 mL conical tubes for mf and L3.

  - Use 50 mL conical tubes for adults. If culturing for more than 48 hrs., place 5 adults per well of a 12-well culture plate containing 6 mL of culture media per well or 3 adults per well of a 12-well culture plate containing 3 mL of culture media per well.

4. Place labeled tubes (with caps loosened) or cell culture plates in 37°C + 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator.

5. Remove 90% of media every 24 hours and replace with fresh media.

### *D. immitis* parasites (L3s, Adults)

*Note:* Make culture media and scale volume as needed. Estimate ~ 4 mL media / adult. Media can be stored at 4°C for 1 month. pH to 7.2 with NaOH droplets or HCl using pH meter. Vacuum filter (0.22 μm filter).

  | Culture Media Component  | Volume (for 50 mL total) |
  |------------|-----------|
  |RPMI-1640 | 44 mL  |
  |Pen-Strep (100 U/mL each)   | 500 μL of 100X stock (10,000 U/mL each) |
  |HEPES (20 mM) | 500 μL of 2M HEPES |
  |D-glucose (1% w/v) | 0.5 g |
  |NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (1% w/v)| 0.5 g |
  |FBS (10% v/v) | 5 mL |

Follow protocol for *Brugia*, with the following modifications: Culture adults at **39°C** in 250 mL cell culture flasks with caps loosened if unfiltered flasks are used. Culture L3s at **39°C** in labeled 15 mL conical tubes (with caps loosened).

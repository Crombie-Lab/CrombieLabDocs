## Protocol
### Preparation of Culture Media
1. In an autoclaved glass bottle, add the following in the exact order listed:

    | Culture Media Component    | Volume/Quantity (250 mL)        |
    |----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
    |NCTC-135 Powder                   |1.16 g                                   |
    |NaHCO<sub>3</sub>                   |0.28 g                                    |
    |H<sub>2</sub>O                  |125 mL                                   |
    |IMDM                   |125 mL                                   |
    |Pen-Strep (10000 U/mL)   |2.5 mL |
    |Gentamicin |2.5 mL        |
    |Fungin                   |250 µL                                   |
    |Ciprofloxacin                  |250 µL                                   |
    |FBS       |50 mL                                    |

2. Replace cap on media bottle and shake to mix. Filter the media using a 0.22 µm filter.

3. Label filtered media with: name of media, volume, date prepared, and initials. Store media at 4°C. Media is good for 1 month post-preparation.

### Extraction of *D. immitis* L3 from Mosquitoes

Follow this [Protocol](../L3_Extraction/L3_Extraction.md)

### Preparing Parasites and Culture Plates (24-well bulk culture)

1. Wash infective larvae:
    - Transfer infective larvae in minimal amount of RPMI-1640 to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
    - Spin the microcentrifuge tube at 1000 x g for 10 minutes.
    - Pipette 100 μL from bottom of tube and transfer to new tube containing 500 μL RPMI.
    - To prevent worm loss, check wash from original tube by pipetting remaining solution into petri dish and examining under dissecting microscope. If a significant number of worms were left behind, pipette into the new tube with NI and spin again.
    - Repeat spin/washing infective larvae in media three times following the steps above.

2. Under BSC, pipette 200 μL from bottom of microcentrifuge tube and transfer to new petri dish containing pre-warmed, sterile culture media

3. Prepare 24-well cell culture plates with 800 µL of culture media under sterile conditions. **Optional:** Add a transwell to each well using a sterile forceps (Fisher Scientific 07-200-154).

4. Transfer desired number of infective larvae (typically 25) in a volume of 200 µL from petri dish to each
well in 24-well plates (total volume = 1 mL). Total of 600 larvae is typically used to fill an entire plate. Larvae are incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2.

5. Change media under BSC every two days by transferring worms (in transwells) to new wells containing fresh culture media using sterile forceps.

6. L3 molting should be monitored daily using a compound scope at 40x-200x total magnification.

**General Note**: A majority of *D. immitis* L3 should molt within the first 2-3 days in culture.


### Preparing Parasites and Culture Plates (96-well individual culture)

1. Prepare a 96-well cell culture plate by adding 200 µL of molting culture media per well under sterile conditions.

2. Wash freshly extracted L3, as described above.

3. Transfer one L3 in a volume of 1 µL from petri dish containing culture media and L3 to each well of a 96-well plate.

4. Place plate containing individually cultured L3 at 37°C with 5% CO2

5. L3 molting should be monitored daily using a compound scope at 40x-200x total magnification.

## Methods
### Preparation of Culture Media
1. In an autoclaved glass bottle, add the following in the exact order listed:

    | Culture Media Component    | Volume/Quantity (250 mL)        |
    |----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
    |NCTC-135 Powder                   |1.16 g                                   |
    |NaHCO<sub>3</sub>                   |0.28 g                                    |
    |H<sub>2</sub>O                  |125 mL                                   |
    |IMDM                   |125 mL                                   |
    |Pen-Strep (10000 U/mL)   |2.5 mL |
    |Gentamicin |2.5 mL        |
    |Fungin                   |250 µL                                   |
    |Ciprofloxacin                  |250 µL                                   |
    |FBS       |50 mL                                    |

2. Replace cap on media bottle and shake to mix. Filter the media using a 0.22 µm filter.

3. Label filtered media with: name of media, volume, date prepared, and initials. Media is good for 1 month post-preparation.

### Extraction of *D. immitis* L3 from Mosquitoes

Follow this [Protocol](../L3_Extraction/L3_Extraction.md)

### Preparing Parasites and Culture Plates

1. Wash infective larvae in culture media three times with fresh, pre-warmed culture media.

2. Prepare a 96-well cell culture plate with 200 µL of culture media per well under sterile conditions.

3. Transfer one L3 in a volume of 1 µL from petri dish containing culture media and L3 to each well of a 96-well plate.

4. Place plate containing individually cultured L3 at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>

5. L3 molting should be monitored daily using a compound scope at 40x-200x total magnification.

**General Note**: A majority of *D. immitis* L3 should molt within the first 2-3 days in culture.

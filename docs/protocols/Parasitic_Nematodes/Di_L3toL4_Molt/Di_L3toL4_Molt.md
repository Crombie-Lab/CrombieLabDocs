## Protocol
### Preparation of Culture Media
1. In an autoclaved glass bottle, prepare the following:

    Preparing NCTC if using powder form (1/8th the packet). Store at 4C for up to one month.

      | NCTC Media Component    | Volume/Quantity (125 mL) |
      |----------------------------|------------------------|
      |NCTC-135 Powder             |1.16 g                  |
      |NaHCO<sub>3</sub>           |0.28 g                  |
      |H<sub>2</sub>O              |125 mL                  |
      |HEPES (1M) - optional       |3.125 mL                |

    Preparing Molting Media (NCTC-IMDM)

      | NI Media Component    | Volume/Quantity (100 mL) |
      |----------------------------|------------------------|
      |NCTC                        |40 mL                  |
      |IMDM                        |40 mL                  |
      |Pen-Strep (100X)            |1 mL (10 U/mL final)                 |
      |Gentamicin (100X)           |1 mL (100 ug/mL final)               |
      |Fungin (1000X)              |100 µL (10 ug/mL final)               |
      |Ciprofloxacin (1000X) - optional      |100 µL (10 ug/mL final)                |
      |FBS                         |20 mL (20% final)        |

    Alternatively, replace P/S and Fungin with 100X Antibiotic-Antimycotic.

2. Replace cap on media bottle and shake to mix. Filter the media using a 0.22 µm filter.

3. Label filtered media with: name of media, volume, date prepared, and initials. Store media at 4°C. Media is good for 1 month post-preparation.

### Extraction of *D. immitis* L3 from Mosquitoes

Follow this [Protocol](../L3_Extraction/L3_Extraction.md)

### Preparing Parasites and Culture Plates (24-well bulk culture)

1. Wash infective larvae:
    - Transfer infective larvae in minimal amount of RPMI-1640 to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
    - Spin the microcentrifuge tube at 1000 x g for 10 minutes.
    - Pipette 100 μL from bottom of tube and transfer to new tube containing 500 μL RPMI.
    - To prevent worm loss, check wash from original tube by pipetting remaining solution into petri dish and examining under dissecting microscope. If a significant number of worms were left behind, pipette into the new tube with NI and spin again.
    - Repeat spin/washing infective larvae in media three times following the steps above.

2. Under BSC, pipette 200 μL from bottom of microcentrifuge tube and transfer to new petri dish containing pre-warmed, sterile culture media

3. Prepare 24-well cell culture plates with 800 µL of culture media under sterile conditions. **Optional:** Add a transwell to each well using a sterile forceps (Fisher Scientific 07-200-154).

4. Transfer desired number of infective larvae (typically 25) in a volume of 200 µL from petri dish to each
well in 24-well plates (total volume = 1 mL). Total of 600 larvae is typically used to fill an entire plate. Larvae are incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2.

5. Change media under BSC every two days by transferring worms (in transwells) to new wells containing fresh culture media using sterile forceps.

6. L3 molting should be monitored daily using a compound scope at 40x-200x total magnification.

**Note**: A majority of *D. immitis* L3 should molt within the first 2-3 days in culture.


### Preparing Parasites and Culture Plates (96-well individual culture)

1. Prepare a 96-well cell culture plate by adding 200 µL of molting culture media per well under sterile conditions.

2. Wash freshly extracted L3, as described above.

3. Transfer one L3 in a volume of 1 µL from petri dish containing culture media and L3 to each well of a 96-well plate.

4. Place plate containing individually cultured L3 at 37°C with 5% CO2

5. L3 molting should be monitored daily using a compound scope at 40x-200x total magnification.

# Total Parasite RNA Storage and Extraction

## Methods

### A. Protocol for maximizing RNA purity
To be used if RNA integrity & purity are critical, or sample volume is limited (RNA-seq, qPCR).

#### Tissue storage

1. Use new filter tips, clean work area in cell culture hood with Eliminase (Room 223), set up liquid nitrogen in small tank.


2. Wash sample in nuclease-free media or PBS:

|Parasite Stage| Wash Method|Quantity for Sufficient RNA|
|----------------------------|------|----------------------------------------|
|mf                          |   Filter mf using SWMP Millipore filters. Wash filter in 1 mL clean PBS or RPMI. Spin at 900 rpm for 10 min.   |500,000                                 |
|L3             |Wash L3 in a petri dish or falcon tubes containing clean wash buffer. Transfer L3 into 1.5 mL tubes after wash    |300+ |
|Adult              |  Wash Adults in a petri dish or falcon tubes containing clean wash buffer. Transfer Adults into 1.5 mL tubes after wash      | 1-3   |  

3. Reduce volume to 100 μL. Add 300 μL TRIzol LS (4°C Passenger Pigeon), mix by vortex and spin down briefly.

4. Snap freeze in liquid nitrogen.

5. Store at -80°C.

6. **If time allows, perform RNA extraction immediately.**

#### RNA extraction

1. Clean hood with Eliminase and check Zymo kit contents (RNA extraction drawer Room 223). Make a stock of 100% molecular grade ethanol (flammable cabinet Room 230).

2. Tissue lysis:

    - Clean TissueLyser LT (Room 223) and centrifuge with Eliminase prior to use.

    - Remove samples from -80°C and thaw on ice or at RT.

    - Set up 2 mL Safelock tubes with one Qiagen smashing bead per tube (RNA extraction drawer Room 223). Label.

    - Transfer specimen to Safelock tube (RNA extraction drawer Room 223).

    - Lock tubes tightly, transfer to TissueLyser LT. Balance tubes. Lyse at 30/s for 3 mins., then incubate for 3 mins. on ice, then another 30/s for 3 mins.

    - Beads may not ‘bash’ using the system at 30/s, if no sound is heard, increase the speed to 36/s for 10 seconds then drop it back to 30/s.

3. Zymo Column Purification

    - Add 400 μL 100% molecular grade ethanol and mix by pipette then transfer to Zymo spin column.

    - Add to single column. Follow kit instructions.

    - **Perform DNase treatment.** If using ultra-low input RNA check to see if this step should be skipped.

    - Use only the best quality nuclease free water for elution of RNA, elute in minimum volume if required, otherwise perform two elations at standard size for maximum yield.

    - If enough yield is expected for QC, remove 1 µL and store separately.

    - Snap freeze, label with appropriate sample ID & concentration. Store at -80°C.

    - QC by Nanodrop (Room 311) if yield is high (single adult, >200 L3) or by BioAnalyzer for low input samples (single cell preps, FACS prep).

### B. Generic RNA extraction protocol

To be used if RNA integrity & purity are less critical.

#### Tissue storage

1. Use new filter tips, clean work area in cell culture hood with Eliminase (Room 223), set up liquid nitrogen in small tank.

2. Wash sample in nuclease free media or PBS as described in the protocol (A) above.

3. Reduce volume to 100 µL and add 300 µL TRIzol LS (4°C Passenger Pigeon)

4. Snap freeze in liquid nitrogen.

5. Store at -80°C.

6.  **If time allows, perform RNA extraction immediately.**

#### RNA extraction

1. Cool centrifuge to 4°C

2. Perform tissue lysis:

    a. Clean TissueLyzer LT (Room 223) and centrifuge with Eliminase   prior to use.

    b. Remove samples from -80°C and thaw on ice or at RT.

    c. Set up 2 mL Safelock tubes with one Qiagen smashing bead per  tube (RNA extraction drawer Room 223). Label.

    d. Transfer specimen to Safelock tube (RNA extraction drawer Room  223).

    e. Lock tubes tightly, transfer to TissueLyser LT. Balance tubes.  Lyse at 30/s for 3 minutes, then incubate for 3 minutes on ice,   then another 30/s for 3 minutes.

      - Beads may not ‘bash’ using the system at 30/s, if no sound is heard, increase the speed to 36/s for 10 seconds then drop it back to 30/s.

3. Add 200 µL chloroform (flammable cabinet Room 230) per 0.8 m: TRIzol / TRIzol LS mix. Shake for 15 seconds, do not over shake just ensure the mix is opaque pink.

4. Spin at 12,000 rcf for 10 mins. at 4°C.

5. Remove tubes carefully and pipette off top aqueous phase.
Add 1 mL 100% isopropanol (flammable cabinet Room 230), mix and incubate at room temp for 10 minutes.

6. Spin at 15,000 rcf for 15 mins. at 4°C.

7. Remove supernatant and wash in 70% ethanol. Check to see pellet.

8. Spin again for 5 mins.

9. Remove ethanol with P1000, spin again, remove ethanol with p100, spin again, remove ethanol with P10, until no ethanol is visible. Air dry for 5 minutes.

10. Add 10-20 µL nuclease free water.

11. Nanodrop and gel QC checks should be performed.

    - Expect a 260:280 reading of ~2.0. 1.8 means DNA contamination, >2.2 means salt contamination.

12. Snap freeze, label with appropriate sample ID and store at -80°C.

### C. RNA tomography protocol

Use for ultra-low input samples or when >20 reactions are performed simultaneously; Requires Zymo Directzol Kit (Room 230); 60 samples takes 3-4 hours to perform.

#### RNA extraction

1. Clean collection plates with Eliminase (Room 230) at least 1 hr. before use.

2. Clean the centrifuge (Yoshino Lab-Biotron), prepare foil covers, and prepare repeat pipette and tips.

3. Perform all steps in the hood when possible.

4. Keep tubes on dry ice and organize plates for use. Balance two plates and split samples accordingly.

5. Prepare nuclease-free water and Trizol LS. Add 100 µL nuclease-free water, to dissolve OCT. Mix by vortex for 10 s. Add 300 uL Trizol LS. Mix and leave at RT. Move through all samples.

6. Add an equal volume of 100% EtOH to sample in Trizol LS. Mix well.

7. Add each sample to appropriate position in plate. Cover and label plates. Spin.

8. **Perform DNase treatment.**

9. Check that wells are dry, then move to new collection plate. Add wash buffer using repeat pipette.

10. Follow rest of protocol. For every 15 µL of DNase/RNase-free water used to elute RNA, expect 8 µL in elution plate.

11. After elution, snap freeze on dry ice and store plate with labels.

12. If QC is desired, add extra samples, remove those from wells before freezing into separate tubes.

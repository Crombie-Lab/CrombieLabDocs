# Total Parasite RNA Extraction

### Materials
- RPMI-1640  
- 2.5 inch strainer (tiny mesh, local hardware store)  
- Ziploc disposable plastic dishes 8oz (top cut off)  
- 50 mL tubes   
- Gentamicin  
- Pen-Strep
- Ice bucket

## Tissue storage

1. Use new filter tips, clean work area in cell culture hood with Eliminase, and procure liquid nitrogen in small tank.

2. Wash sample in nuclease-free media or PBS:

    |Stage| Wash Method | Ideal Quantity|
    |----------------------------|------|----------------------------------------|
    |mf                          |   Filter mf using SWMP Millipore filters. Wash filter in 1 mL clean PBS or RPMI. Spin at 900 rpm for 10 min.   |500,000                                 |
    |L3             |Wash L3 in a petri dish or falcon tubes containing clean wash buffer. Transfer L3 into 1.5 mL tubes after wash    |300+ |
    |Adult              |  Wash Adults in a petri dish or falcon tubes containing clean wash buffer. Transfer Adults into 1.5 mL tubes after wash      | 1-3   |  

3. Draw off media leaving ~ 100 μL behind. Add 300 μL TRIzol LS, mix by vortex and spin down briefly.

4. Snap freeze in liquid nitrogen.

5. Store at -80°C.

6. **If time allows, perform RNA extraction immediately.**


## A. RNA extraction and purification

To be used if RNA integrity and purity are critical, or tissue input is limited (RNA-seq, qPCR).

1. Use new filter tips, clean work area in cell culture hood with Eliminase. Make a stock of 100% molecular grade ethanol (flammable cabinet).

2. Tissue lysis via TissueLyser

    - Clean TissueLyser LT and centrifuge with Eliminase prior to use.

    - Remove TRIzol samples from -80°C and thaw on ice.

    - Set up and label 2 mL Safelock tubes with one Qiagen smashing bead per tube.

    - Transfer thawed samples to Safelock tubes.

    - Lock tubes tightly, transfer to TissueLyser LT. Balance tubes. Lyse at 30/s for 3 mins., then incubate for 3 mins. on ice, then another 30/s for 3 mins.

    - Beads may not ‘bash’ using the system at 30/s, if no sound is heard, increase the speed to 36/s for 10 seconds then drop it back to 30/s.

3. Zymo Column Purification

    - Add 400 μL 100% molecular grade ethanol and mix by pipette then transfer to Zymo spin column.

    - Follow Zymo kit instructions.

    - **Perform DNase treatment.**

    - Use fresh nuclease free water for elution of RNA, elute in minimum volume if required, otherwise perform two elutions for maximum yield.

    - If enough yield is expected for QC, remove 1 µL and store separately.

    - Snap freeze, label with appropriate sample ID & concentration. Store at -80°C.

    - QC by Nanodrop if yield is high (single adult, >200 L3) or by BioAnalyzer for low input samples (single cell preps, FACS prep).

### B. Alternative RNA extraction and purification protocol

To be used if RNA integrity & purity are less critical.

1. Use new filter tips, clean work area in cell culture hood with Eliminase. Make a stock of 100% molecular grade ethanol (flammable cabinet).

2. Cool centrifuge to 4°C

3. Tissue lysis via TissueLyser

    - Clean TissueLyser LT and centrifuge with Eliminase prior to use.

    - Remove TRIzol samples from -80°C and thaw on ice.

    - Set up and label 2 mL Safelock tubes with one Qiagen smashing bead per tube.

    - Transfer thawed samples to Safelock tubes.

    - Lock tubes tightly, transfer to TissueLyser LT. Balance tubes. Lyse at 30/s for 3 mins., then incubate for 3 mins. on ice, then another 30/s for 3 mins.

    - Beads may not ‘bash’ using the system at 30/s, if no sound is heard, increase the speed to 36/s for 10 seconds then drop it back to 30/s.

3. Add 200 µL chloroform (flammable cabinet) per 0.8 m: TRIzol mix. Shake for 15 seconds, do not over shake just ensure the mix is opaque pink.

4. Spin at 12,000 rcf for 10 mins. at 4°C.

5. Remove tubes carefully and pipette off top aqueous phase. Add 1 mL 100% isopropanol (flammable cabinet Room 230), mix and incubate at room temp for 10 minutes.

6. Spin at 15,000 rcf for 15 mins. at 4°C.

7. Remove supernatant and wash in 70% ethanol (check for visible pellet).

8. Spin again for 5 mins.

9. Remove ethanol with P1000, spin again, remove ethanol with p100, spin again, remove ethanol with P10, until no ethanol is visible. Air dry for 5 minutes.

10. Add 10-20 µL nuclease free water.

11. Nanodrop and gel QC checks should be performed.

    - Expect a 260:280 reading of ~2.0. 1.8 means DNA contamination, >2.2 suggests salt contamination.

12. Snap freeze, label with appropriate sample ID and store at -80°C.

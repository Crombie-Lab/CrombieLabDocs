## Isolating Regions of Interest from Tissue Cross-Sections

### Embedding

Follow the [Cryoembedding](../Cryoembedding/Cryoembedding.md) protocol to embed parasites into OCT for subsequent sectioning.

### Preparing PEN Membrane Slides for Cryosectioning

1. Under BSC, treat PEN membrane slides for 1 min with Eliminase.

2. Rinse the slides by dipping 10 times with 1-2 seconds between dips in three successive conical tubes filled with 30 mL DEPC-treated water.

3. Dip slides in 95% ethanol 10 times.
Air-dry for 5–10 min.

### Cryosectioning

Follow Follow the [Cryosectioning](../Cryostat/Cryostat.md) to produce tissue sections for LCM. 20 µm sections are typically collected for all stages of filarial parasites.

### Transferring sections from cryostat onto PEN membrane

1. Place a PEN Membrane on the back half of the main stage in the cryostat.

2. Trim the embedded sample block until dye dot is visible. Count the number of slices passed until no more dye is visible. Calculate the number of slices required to reach tissue by comparing the number of dye slices across the dot to the width of the dot in pixels, this gives a slice to pixel ratio. Use the measurement between the end of the dot and the specimen to get another slice to pixel ratio. Solve for the theoretical number of slices it will take to get to the start of the worm by cross-multiplying. It is good practice to underestimate this number by **at least 20%**. Visibly inspect slices periodically under the microscope and proceed if no tissue is visible.

3. Once you visibly see tissue in your section, using clean forceps, transfer the slice to the PEN membrane slide in a column-like fashion. Continue collecting slices until the PEN membrane slide is completely filled with sections (usually 35-40 sections per slide).

    **Note:** Use caution when transferring sections to the PEN membrane, so the PEN membrane doesn’t get torn or punctured by the forceps.

4. Remove the slide from the inside of the cryostat and move to room temperature for 2-5 minutes.

5. Place the slide in a 50 mL conical tube. Leave the tube containing the slide at room temperature and bring back to the lab for processing.

6. To process the slide, remove the slide from the conical tube and place in a clean cover from a pipette tip box. Using a p1000 pipette, **carefully** flood the slide with 70% EtOH. Let sit for 1-2 minutes.

7. Tilt the slide to dump the ethanol off. Using a p1000 pipette, gently wash the slide with molecular grade water.

8. Using a p1000 pipette, **carefully** flood the slide with 80% EtOH. Let sit for 1 minute.

9. Tilt the slide to dump the ethanol off. If you notice white on the slide after removing the ethanol, this is the remaining OCT that has not been fully removed. Use a p1000 and molecular grade water to wash the white areas until the OCT is dissolved.

10. Using a p1000 pipette, **carefully** flood the slide with 90% EtOH. Let sit for 1 minute.

11. Tilt the slide to dump the ethanol off. Using a p1000 pipette, **carefully** flood the slide with 90% EtOH. Let sit for 1 minute.

12. Tilt the slide to dump the ethanol off. Using a p1000 pipette, **carefully** flood the slide with 100% EtOH. Let sit for 1 minute.

13. Tilt the slide to dump off the ethanol. Allow to air dry. Wipe the bottom and edges of the slide to facilitate quicker drying.

14. Verify there are visible sections on the slide using compound microscopy.

15. Place the slide back into the 50 mL conical tube, label the tube, and place it in the -80ºC until you are ready to go to the LCM.


## Isolating Regions of Interest from Whole-Mount Microfilariae

### Ethanol fixing mf

1. Filter shipped mf using a 30 µm SWMP Millipore filter. Push the mf through the filter once, and collect the flow-through.

2. Push the flow-through through a new 5 µm filter. Remove the filter from the filter holder using clean forceps and transfer to a 15 mL conical tube containing 1 mL of RPMI + 1% P/S. Rinse the filter off by swirling it around inside the conical tube using forceps.

3. Remove the filter from the conical tube and discard. Transfer the contents of the conical tube to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Centrifuge at 1000 x g for 5 minutes. Remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet of mf.

4. Using a pipette, add 1 mL of 100% EtOH drop by drop to the pellet of mf. Once all the ethanol is added briefly vortex so the mf are evenly suspended throughout the ethanol.

5. Label and place the tube of mf at -80ºC until you are ready to go to LCM.

### Preparation of PEN membrane slides containing Whole-Mount Microfilariae

Place the sample of ethanol-fixed mf on wet-ice to bring to the LCM. At the LCM, when you are ready to add the slide to the machine, add the mf to the RNase treated PEN membrane slide (see above on how to prepare PEN membrane slides). Briefly vortex the tube by flicking so mf are evenly suspended in the ethanol. Using a p20 pipette, pipette 3-4 10 µL aliquots equidistant from each other along the length of the PEN Membrane. Allow the ethanol to evaporate before adding the slide to the machine.


### Preparation of PEN Membrane Slides containing Parasite Tissue Cross-Sections

1. Remove from previously prepared PEN membrane slides from ice and immediately immerse in cold 100% ethanol for 30 seconds.

2. Immerse the slide in room temperature 100% ethanol.

3. Air dry slides for 2-3 minutes. This will prevent rehydration of sections and prevent re-activation of RNase activity during warming.

### Locating Parasite Samples for Microdissection

1. Load your caps and slide onto the ArcturusXT system. Load slide (one at a time) so that the frosted part of the slide is pointing to the right, and the PEN membrane facing up. Push the tension button, in order to load the slides. Release tension button to lock slides into place.

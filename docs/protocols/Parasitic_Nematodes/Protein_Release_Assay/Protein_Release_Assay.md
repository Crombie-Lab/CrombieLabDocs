### Protein Purification

1. Retrieve conditioned media from the -80°C freezer and thaw at room temperature.

2. If pooling is necessary, pool thawed samples into 1.7 mL tubes and evaporate on the SpeedVac at medium setting. Liquid will evaporate at ~500 μL per hour. Pool to <500 μL (the maximum input for the filter plates).

3. Load 500 μL of thawed conditioned media to a 0.2 μm filter plate on top of a **clean** deep well plate.

4. Centrifuge at 1500 x *g* for 1 min.

5. Transfer the flow-through to a 3K filter plate on top of a **used** deep well plate (i.e., the original plate from which the flow-through was taken).

6. Centrifuge at 1500 x *g* for 45 min.

7. Add 500 μL PBS to each well.

8. Centrifuge at 1500 x *g* for 45 min.

9. Use a p20 pipette to check multiple wells to ensure <10 μL remains in each well. If more than 10 μL remains, perform an additional 20-40 min. spin.

### Protein quantitation

10. Dilute the NanoOrange protein quantitation diluent 10-fold in distilled water.

11. Thaw the NanoOrange protein quantitation reagent at room temperature; dilute 500-fold in diluent from step 10 to create the working solution.

    - For example, to prepare 50 mL of 1X NanoOrange® working solution (enough for 20 assays), first pre pare the 1X diluent by mixing 5 mL of the 10X diluent stock with 45 mL of distilled water; next add 100 µL of the NanoOrange® reagent and mix thoroughly. Protect the 1X NanoOrange working solution from light to prevent photodegradation of the NanoOrange dye. For best results, use the working solution within a few hours of its preparation.

12. Create a standard curve by performing the following dilutions:

| Tube | Volume BSA | Volume 1X Working Solution | Final BSA Concentration |
|------|------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
|      | 0 mL       | 2.5 mL                     | 0 μg/mL                 |
| A    | 2.5        | 0 mL                       | 10 μg/mL                |
|      | 1.5 of A   | 1 mL                       | 6 μg/mL                 |
|      | 0.75 of A  | 1.75 mL                    | 3 μg/mL                 |
| B    | 0.25 of A  | 2.25 mL                    | 1 μg/mL                 |
|      | 1.5 of B   | 1 mL                       | 0.6 μg/mL               |
|      | 0.75 of B  | 1.75 mL                    | 0.3 μg/mL               |
| C    | 0.25 of B  | 2.25 mL                    | 0.1 μg/mL               |
|      | 1.50 of C  | 1 mL                       | 0.06 μg/mL              |
|      | 0.75 of C  | 1.75 mL                    | 0.03 μg/mL              |
|      | 0.25 of C  | 2.25 mL                    | 0.01 μg/mL              |



13. Incubate samples at 90°C to 96°C for 10 minutes, **protected from light.**

14. Cool to room temperature for 20 minutes, **protected from light.**

# Infecting Mosquitoes with Microfilaremic Blood

## Materials

- Glass slides
- Glass cover slips
- Defibrinated Sheep's Blood (Hemostat Laboratories DSB100)
- Bleach
- Glass or electric blood feeders
- Parafilm
- Ring stand (glass feeders only)


## Preparing blood for blood feeding

All pipette tips, slides, serological pipettes, tubes, and other materials that come into contact with blood throughout this protocol must be treated with bleach prior to disposal. A bleach solution can be prepared in the bleach-specific pitcher in the insectary (labeled with yellow tape) by adding ~1/2 cup of bleach and 1 L of tap water.

**Important**: Remove the sucrose pad(s) at least 2 hr before feeding for LVP and AaSD mosquito species.

### Starting with microfilaremic blood

1. Invert the tube of infected blood several times to mix the microfilariae (mf).

  **Note**: If the microfilariae are shipped in multiple glass vials from the same subject, combine all of the vials into a single 50 mL conical tube and mix by inversion.

2. Add 20 µL of infected blood to 50 µL of dH<sub>2</sub>O on a glass slide and stir with the pipette tip to mix.

3. Add a cover slip to the slide. Adding the cover slip beginning at an angle and slowly lowering it will reduce bubbles in the middle of your slide.

4. Return the mf back to the incubator while counting.

5. Place the slide on a compound microscope and count the mf. Start at a corner of the cover slip and count the mf in the fluid outside of the coverslip. Once the perimeter has been counted, count the mf underneath the cover slip area using an s-pattern. (See figure below)

6. Calculate the mf concentration in the microfilaremic blood stock.

7. In a 15 mL or 50 mL conical tube, dilute the microfilaremic blood with Defibrinated Sheep's Blood to the desired blood feeding concentration. Use C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>=C<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub> to calculate how much microfilaremic blood and how much control blood to add to the conical tube.

  **Note:** The blood feeders used for feeding hold 10 mL of blood. When calculating final volume use 11 mL for 1 mL overage. Multiply this by number of feeders you will need.

- Appropriate concentrations for blood feeding:

  - *B. pahangi*: 120 – 160 mf / 20 µL

  - *D. immitis*: 80 – 160 mf / 20 µL

8. Re-enumerate the mf in blood in duplicate to verify that it is within target concentration for the designated species (see target concentrations above). If concentration is off, re-calculate dilutions based on the new numbers and add defibrinated sheep's blood as needed.

###  Starting with mf in IP fluid

1. Invert the tube in order for mf to be evenly distributed throughout IP fluid.

2. Use the concentration printed on the outside of the tube containing the IP fluid. Determine how much volume of IP fluid you will need to get the desired mf concentration for blood feeding by using C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>=C<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>.

    **Note:**  The blood feeders used for feeding hold 10 mL of blood. When calculating final volume use 11 mL for 1 mL overage. Multiply this by number of feeders you will need.

3. Add the calculated amount of IP fluid to a 15 mL conical tube. Spin at 900 rpm for 10 min. You should see a pellet of mf at the bottom of the tube. Remove all supernatant without disturbing pellet. Add the final volume of blood you desire (11 mL x the number o feeders).

4. Re-enumerate the mf in blood in duplicate to verify that it is within target concentration for the designated species (see target concentrations above). If concentration is off, re-calculate dilutions based on the new numbers and add defibrinated sheep's blood as needed.

## Assembling **glass** blood feeders and feeding mosquitoes

1. Use the large glass blood feeders. Stretch a 2-square piece of parafilm pulled once in both directions and place it on the bottom of the glass feeder. Avoid wrinkles in the parafilm and secure the parafilm by smoothing it along the glass rim.

2. Cut a second piece of parafilm (2 squares wide, half square tall) and stretch it around the bottom edge of the glass feeder.

3. Secure the parafilmed glass feeder upside down on a metal ring stand and place on a cart in the insectary.

4. Setup the water circulator on a cart in the insectary by filling it with dH<sub>2</sub>O to the black fill line.

5. Attach the water circulator tubes to each inlet and outlet arm on the side of the glass feeders and wrap a piece of parafilm (2 squares wide, half square tall) around the connecting points. This will help control any water leaks.

6. Turn the water circulator on and set the temperature to 37°C.

7. In these feeders carefully place ~10 mL of diluted, infected blood into the top of the blood feeders using a disposable pipet. You need to make sure that the feeders are level so that the blood doesn’t pool in one side and unevenly distribute the mf.

8. Place a small strip of parafilm over the opening to the inner chamber where the infected blood was loaded into the glass feeder.

9. Let the water, glass feeders, and blood equilibrate to 37°C prior to feeding.

10. Place a carton of mosquitoes under a membrane feeder and slowly lower the feeder so that it rests atop the carton and is flush with the mesh of the carton.

11. Allow the carton of females to feed for 30 – 45 min. or until a majority of females have fed.

12. While the mosquitoes are feeding, print out a carton label according to the example below:

13. When feeding is complete, remove an aliquot of blood to confirm that the mf are still alive and active. Do not separate blood fed from non-blood fed mosquitoes at conclusion of feeding.

14. Affix the carton label to the corresponding carton and place blood fed mosquitoes in the insect incubator.

15. Allow the infection to incubate for 14-15 days before you extract L3 from the mosquitoes.

16. Other important notes:
  - Maintain the sucrose pads on the cartons **daily**. It will be important to communicate with the insectary manager or undergraduates to make sure sucrose pads are moistened every day including on the weekends.

  - If you notice an accumulation of dead mosquitoes in the bottom of the carton, suck out the dead mosquitoes, empty the suction device into a plastic container and freeze the container overnight. The mosquitoes can then be placed in the trash the next day after freezing.

# Larval development assay

## Materials
- 96-well plates used for ImageXpress (USA Scientific 5665-5180Q)
- M9
- Amphotericin B (25 μg/mL final)
- Tylosin tartare (800 μg/ml final)
- Purified eggs
- Frozen OP50 stock

## Equipment
- Incubator set to 26°C

## Protocol
1. In a 96-well plates, combine 50 μL of 2% agar (allow to solidify ), 40 μL of purified egg mixture at 2500 eggs/mL (100 eggs/well), and 10 μL of 10X drug stock.

2. Incubate the plates at 26°C for 24 hr in a humid chamber.

3. The next day, add 10 μL of nutrient solution.

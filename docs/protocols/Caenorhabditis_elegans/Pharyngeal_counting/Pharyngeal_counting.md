##Protocol

##Advanced Preparations

1. Bleach synchronize worm strains following [Bleach_synchronization](../Bleach_synchronization/Bleach_synchronization.md) protocol.

2. Hatch 1,000 embryos on unseeded 10cm NGM plates for L1 assays or seeded 10cm NGM plates for adult assays.

## Adult Assay Protocol

1. 4 days after bleaching wash worms off of 10cm plates with M9 into 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes.

2. Wash and prepare worms:

      a. Wash worms from 10cm NGM plates into 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes using 1 mL of M9, maintaining seperate strains per tube.

      b. Allow worms to settle for 2 minutes.

      c. Remove supernatant without disturbing the worm pellet.

      d. Add 1 mL of M9 and invert to wash worms.

      e. Repeat b-d two more times, for a total of three M9 washes.

3.  After the final wash, add desired drugs + 10mM serotonin and wait 20 minutes.

4. Pipette worms and solution onto an unseeded 10cm plate.

    a. Wait 1-2 minutes.  

5. Pick 5-8 worms without using OP50 to unseeded 6cm assay plates (GFP+ where needed).

  a. Wait 10 minutes before counting the pharyngeal pumps.

6. Use the Axio injection scope count pumps for 10s.

      a. One pump is the movement of the terminal bulb down and back to its starting position.

## L1 Assay Protocol

1. one day after bleaching wash worms off of 10cm plates with M9 into 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes.

2. Prepare worms:

            a. Wash worms from 10cm NGM plates into 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes using 1 mL of M9.


3.  Add desired drugs and wait 20 minutes.

4. Pipette worms and solution onto an unseeded 10cm plate.

          a. Wait 5 minutes.  

5. Pick 5-8 worms to seeded 6cm assay plates (GFP+ where needed).

        a. Wait 10 minutes before counting the pharyngeal pumps.

6. Use the Axio injection scope count pumps for 10s.

            a. One pump is the movement of the terminal bulb down and back to its starting position.

# Chunking Worms

1. Make sure the bottom of the plate to which you are moving the worms is labeled with the strain name and date.

2. Have both your old plate (starved worms, no bacteria) and new plate (no worms, bacteria) ready.

8. After you place the agar chunk down, hold the spatula in the flame of the bunsen burner to melt/burn any remaining agar and worms.

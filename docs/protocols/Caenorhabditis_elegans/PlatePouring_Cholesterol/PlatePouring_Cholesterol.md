# How to Make Cholesterol
Zamanian Lab, adapted from Andersen Lab

*C. elegans* requires cholesterol to progress through the four larval stages. Previously, we found that some filters were removing cholesterol from K medium and S medium. Most worms arrested in larval development. For this reason, we add cholesterol after filtration or autoclaving media for NGMA plates.

**For NGM/HGM plates:**
Use the unfiltered but sterile 5 mg/mL cholesterol in ethanol.

To make this cholesterol,
1. Take an autoclaved sterile 250 mL bottle.

2. Add 1 g of powdered cholesterol (VWR Cat #0433-250G) to the bottle.

3. Add 200 mL of 100% ethanol to the bottle.

4. Cap and shake to resuspend.

5. Store at room temperature on the reagents shelf for up to six months.

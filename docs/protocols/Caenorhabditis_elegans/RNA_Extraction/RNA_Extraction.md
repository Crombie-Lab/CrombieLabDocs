## Phase I

1. 3-4 days before you plan to extract RNA, chunk to three 10 cm plates per strain/line.

    a. Monitor plates daily; extract RNA when plates are full of adults and nearly starved.

    **b. Note that this protocol will extract RNA from a mixed population of worms; you can adapt accordingly if synchronization is required.**

2. When plates are ready, wash worms off of plates and pool by strain/line into 15 mL of M9.

    a. Let settle on ice for 1 hour.

3. Aspirate off M9 and wash with 5 mL of fresh M9.

    a. Let settle on ice for ~15 minutes.

    b. Aspirate M9 and transfer worms to a 1.5 mL tube.

4. Add 1 mL M9.

    a. Spin on minicentrifuge or let settle on ice.

    b. Aspirate M9.

5. Add 1 mL Trizol.

6. Flash-freeze each tube by dropping the tubes bottom first into liquid nitrogen, remove with a ladle or forceps.

7. Thaw tubes in a heat block set to 37°C.

8. Repeat steps 6-7 four additional times.

9. After the last thaw, vortex at 3200 for 30 seconds, then rest for 30 seconds.

    a. Repeat 4 additional times.

    **b. Note that some debris may remain, especially eggs; these will not interfere with RNA extraction yield or purity.**

    c. Store at -80°C or continue to Phase II.

## Phase II

1. Prior to RNA extraction, wipe down your working space, pipettes, and gloves with Eliminase or RNase Zap.

    **a. Ensure that your gloves remain RNase-free; if you touch a contaminated surface (i.e. skin, hair, other lab equipment) or breath on the gloves, they are no longer RNase-free.**

    b. This procedure has been performed on personal bench tops in room 230, but the BSC will provide further sterility if RNA degradation or RNase contamination is a fear.

2. Add 200 μL chloroform per 1 mL Trizol.

    a. Shake vigorously for 15 seconds.

    b. Incubate at room temperature for 3 minutes.

    c. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 15 minutes at 4°C.

    d. Transfer the upper aqueous phase to a new, labelled RNase-free tube.

    **e. Note: be very careful not to transfer any material from the interphase or lower organic phase; if you do, you will see the contamination in the 260:230 values measured by the NanoDrop. It is best to leave some aqueous phase behind in order to decrease the likelihood of transferring contaminants.**

3. Add 500 μL cold isopropanol per 1 mL Trizol.

    a. Mix by inverting tubes 6 times.

    b. Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes.

    **c. Note: RNA yield may be increased by incubation at -20°C overnight; this step also provides a convenient pause point if necessary.**

    d. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C; you should see a white or clear RNA pellet if you chunked enough plates and produced enough adults.

    e. Carefully remove supernatant; it is fine to leave some (~5-10 μL) isopropanol behind and remove it in the ensuing wash.

4. Add 1 mL cold 75% ethanol per 1 mL Trizol.

    a. Pulse vortex.

    b. Centrifuge at 7,500 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C.

    c. Remove the majority of the supernatant with a P1000; remove the remaining with a P20, being careful not to aspirate the RNA pellet but removing all the ethanol.

    d. Allow to air dry (with caps open) for 10 minutes in the BSC, ensure all ethanol is removed/evaporated.

5. Resuspend in 20-50 μL of TE buffer or RNase-free water.

    a. Pipette the pellet up and down to resuspend.

    **b. Note: 2-3 chunked plates should result in the extraction of 30-80 μg of RNA, depending on strain; choose your resuspension volume according to your desired final concentration.**

6. Measure concentration and purity on the NanoDrop in room 311.

    a. This protocol results in ***very pure*** RNA, with 260:280 and 260:230 values between 1.9 and 2.2.

7. Optional, remove contaminating genomic DNA with the Turbo DNase Free kit (find the protocol at ZamanianLab/Protocols/Kits_Manuals/TURBO_DNA-free.pdf).

    **a. Note: DNase treatment is required if planning on performing qPCR, and is strongly suggested in all other cases, especially if the 260:280 values from the NanoDrop reading was <2.**

8. Perform a 1:5 dilution with a 1 μL sample and measure the concentration with Qubit RNA BR.

    **a. Note: the linear range of the RNA BR assay is 1-1000 ng/μL, so use NanoDrop estimates to calculate the appropriate sample dilution.**

    **b. Note: if performing qPCR or other quantitative measurements, the Qubit assay is significantly more reliable than the NanoDrop, and any downstream calculations should incorporate the Qubit measurement.**

    c. Dilute to a a desired final concentration, aliquot if necessary, and store at -80°C.

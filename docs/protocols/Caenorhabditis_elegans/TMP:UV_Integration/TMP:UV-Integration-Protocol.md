# TMP plus UV Integration Protocol
  from Scott Clark, modified by the Kimble lab

### Materials
  - 3mg/mL TMP (trimethyl Psoralen) dissolved in DMSO
  - Stratalinker
  - M9
  - 1.5 mL tubes
  - Tin foil
  - 10 cm unseeded plates
  - OP50 in liquid culture


## Mutagenesis and integration

1. In an Eppendorf tube, add 40 L4 worms in 593.3 µL M9. Do two tubes due to the death rate of the worms.

2. **Do this step in the dark, as TMP is light sensitive** Add to the tubes 6.7 µL of 3mg/mL TMP (trimethyl Psoralen) dissolved in DMSO.

3. Wrap Eppendorf tubes in foil and let sit at RT for 15 min.

4. **Again, do this step in the dark** Then, transfer worm solutions to 10 cm unseeded plates. Swirl the liquid around the plates evenly and cover the plates with foil.

5. Expose the worms to the 350f µJ (x100) long wave UV in Stratalinker 1800 without the lid.
  - set plates on paper towel in Stratalinker
  - turn on Stratalinker
  - hit **energy**
  - choose 350
  - push **start**

6. Spin down ~10 mL OP50 and remove all but 1 mL of liquid, then resuspend. Add concentrated OP50 to the plates. Cover in foil and incubate at 15°C overnight.

7. Pick 1 worm per 6 cm plate for about 25 plates. Number the plates 1-25 to keep track of the original parent.

8. Transfer one worm from each numbered plate onto new numbered 1-25 6 cm plates for two more days.

9. Pick 100-120 plates with 2 worms/6 cm plate (each should be numbered 1-25 to match the original parent) from the 75 plates you have accrued over the last 3 days.
  - there will be some death of worms so you may not have  the full 75 plates anymore. Just pick from what you have left.

10. Pick 2 worms (1 per plate) from each plate from step 9 onto numbered 1-25 6 cm plates. This will result in ~250 plates.

11. Score for 100% integration of the GFP

**NOTE: University of Wisconsin-Madison safety protocol for TMP is to keep the 10 cm plates the TMP was aliquoted onto in a plastic bag and schedule safety pick up. Tips and tubes can go in autoclave trash.**

## Backcrossing integrated lines to remove mutations

1. Select 4 GFP+ integrated hermaphrodites and place on 6 cm plate. Let them crawl around for 5 min.

2. Add ~7-10 N2 male worms to the plate from step 1.

3. Select 4 N2 hermaphrodites and place on 6 cm plate. Let them crawl around for 5 min.

4. Add ~7-10 GFP+ male worms to the plate from step 3.
  - if you cannot find GFP+ males you may have an insertion on the male chromosome. You can then take GFP+ hermaphrodites and mate to N2 males.

5. Steps 1-4 are considered one backcross. Repeat these steps 6-8 times. After 6-8 backcrosses to N2, pick 12 single bright GFP+ hermaphrodites (one per plate).

6. Check for 100% integration.

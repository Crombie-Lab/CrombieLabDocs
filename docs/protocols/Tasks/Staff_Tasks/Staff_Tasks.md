# Staff Maintenance Tasks

## General Lab Upkeep

The items below occur **as needed**. Lab members should warn the assigned person several days in advance and write on the white board in Room 223 on the fridge when a duty needs to be completed:

  - **50x TAE and refilling 1x TAE carboy.** Refill the 1x TAE carboy with milli-Q water from the carboy and 50x TAE. Make 50x TAE. See [General Recipes](../docs/protocols/Molecular_Biology/General_Recipes/General_Recipes.md) for instructions.

  - **100 bp and 1000 bp ladders (from vectors).** See [Ladder Creation](../docs/protocols/Molecular_Biology/Ladder_Creation/Ladder_Creation.md) for instructions.

  - **Loading dye.** Make aliquots of 6x orange loading dye into 1.5 mL tubes. See the loading dye recipe in [General Recipes](../docs/protocols/Molecular_Biology/General_Recipes/General_Recipes.md).

  - **dNTP stocks preparation.** Combine individual commercial 100 mM dNTP stocks (dATP, dTTP, dCTP, dGTP) to make 10 mM working stock aliquots for lab member personal use. Add 10 μL of each dNTP to 60 μL of dH<sub>2</sub>O to make 100 μL aliquots of 10 mM dNTP working stocks.

  - **Competent cells.** See the [Competent Bacteria](?) protocol for instructions.

  - **SOC.** Make 100 mL of SOC media for lab use. Aliquot into 10 mL units and store at 4°C. See [General Recipes](../docs/protocols/Molecular_Biology/General_Recipes/General_Recipes.md) for instructions.

  - **Agarose pads for injections.** Make a large batch of agarose pads (20+) when running low. Follow the protocol in [Microinjection](../docs/protocols/Microinjection/Microinjection.md).

  - **Worm 2x lysis buffer.** This needs to be made rarely, in large batches and frozen. See [_C. elegans_ Recipes](..docs/protocols/Caenorhabditis_elegans/Celegans_Recipes/Celegans_Recipes.md).

  - **M9 stock replenishment.** Make three 1 L stocks of M9 in glass bottles when running low. Follow the recipe in [_C. elegans_ Recipes](..docs/protocols/Caenorhabditis_elegans/Celegans_Recipes/Celegans_Recipes.md). Be sure to autoclave and then add 1 M MgSO<sub>4</sub> once cool.

## Equipment Maintenance

(See [Equipment Checklist](?))

  - **Injection setup maintenance.** See [Injection Rig Preparation](../docs/protocols/Microinjection/Injection_Rig_Preparation/Injection_Rig_Preparation.md) for maintenance instructions.

  - **Incubator maintenance.** The water-jacketed incubator has many critical maintenance requirements, including ensuring humidity pans are full, adding rust inhibitor to the water jacket, and completing full decontamination procedures. See [Water-jacketed Incubators](../docs/protocols/Lab_Operations/Waterjacketed_Incubator/Waterjacketed_Incubator.md) for full instructions.

  - **Replacing incubator CO<sub>2</sub> tanks.** The water-jacketed incubator requires replacement of CO<sub>2</sub> tanks before tanks empty. See [Connecting CO<sub>2</sub> Tanks](../docs/protocols/General/Connecting_CO2_Tanks/Connecting_CO2_Tanks.md) for full instructions.

  - **Liquid N<sub>2</sub> tank upkeep.** The liquid N<sub>2</sub> tank stores our critical backup copies of transgenic worm strains and transformed bacterial stocks. Follow [Liquid N<sub>2</sub> Tank Maintenance](../docs/protocols/Lab_Operations_LiquidN2_Tank_Maintenance/LiquidN2_Tank_Maintenance.md) for maintenance instructions.

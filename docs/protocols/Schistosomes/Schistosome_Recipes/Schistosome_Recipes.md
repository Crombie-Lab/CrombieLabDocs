## iBge Medium pH 7.2

|Reagent|Amount (per 100 mL)|
|-------|------|
|Schneider's Drosophila Medium|22 mL|
|Lactalbumin hydrolysate|450 mg|
|Galactose|130 mg|
|Sterile DI water|68 mL|
|Gentamicin 50 mg/ml stock (*Optional*)|0.2 mL|

- Filter sterilize (0.22 um filter) and store at 4C

To prepare cBge medium, add 10 mL of heat inactivated FBS and 1 mL of 100X pen/strep to 89 mL iBge.

- **Note:** iBge is very easily contaminated

**Note:** Do not freeze cBge Medium

**Note:** Bge cells are sensitive to the quality of FBS. Several lots of FBS may have to be screened. It has been known that investigators using Bge cell lines have soon lost it due to the unsuitability of their FBS.

## Pond Water Stock Solution

|Reagent|Amount (per 1 L)|
|-------|------|
|CaCO<sub>3</sub>|12.5 g|
|MgCO<sub>3</sub>|1.25 g|
|NaCl|1.25 g|
|KCl|0.25 g|

- Pond water stocks are prepared in small Nalgene containers and stored on the supply rack in B7.

- Shake the stock bottle well before diluting, as the reagents and salts may have settled on the bottom.

- Common working Pond Water dilutions:

    - 100 mL Pond Water Stock --> 30 Gallons dH<sub>2</sub>O

    - 33 ml Pond Water Stock --> 10 Gallons dH<sub>2</sub>O

    - 16.5 mL Pond Water Stock --> 5 Gallons dH<sub>2</sub>O

    - 12 ml Pond Water Stock --> 10 Litres dH<sub>2</sub>O

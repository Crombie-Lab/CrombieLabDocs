# Liquid Nitrogen Tank Operation and Maintenance

Locator Jr. Plus Specifications:
  - Liquid N<sub>2</sub> capacity: 71 L
  - Liquid N<sub>2</sub> evaporation rate: 0.85 L/day

**WARNINGS:**

  1. The tank uses a vacuum to ensure temperature control and care must be taken to prevent premature vacuum loss.

  2. **Do not tamper with or remove the vacuum port** (covered by a black plastic cap on the side of the vessel).

  3. **When inserting or removing racks, be careful not to come into contact with the neck tube area of the vessel. Remove them slowly in a vertical manner. Scratches on the neck tube area can cause premature vacuum failure.**

  4. Do not use the tank for transport. Use an intermediate liquid N<sub>2</sub> vessel to transport liquid N<sub>2</sub> from the dock to the tank. Cracks in the floor and bumping into objects can disrupt the vacuum.

## Adding liquid N<sub>2</sub> to a warm vessel:

1. Add only a small amount of liquid N<sub>2</sub> (5-10 liters) to the new or warm vessel. Liquid N<sub>2</sub> is available on the first floor on the dock.

2. Allow this small amount of liquid N<sub>2</sub> to sit in the covered vessel for at least 2 hr. to allow the vessel to equilibrate to the temperature change.

3. Add an additional 15 liters of liquid N<sub>2</sub> to the vessel and allow the vessel to sit for 48 hr. Monitor the liquid N<sub>2</sub> consumption with a wooden yardstick (never a hollow tube or plastic dipstick).
4. Fill the vessel with liquid N<sub>2</sub> **no higher than the top of the racks (approximately 12 inches with racks inserted).**
5. Insert and remove racks slowly. Allow the liquid N<sub>2</sub> to run out of boxes and off racks before completely removing from the Locator.

## Maintenance

1. Monitor the level of liquid N<sub>2</sub> in the tank every 1-2 days to anticipate subtle changes in consumption and prevent problems before they arise. Keep a record of the liquid N<sub>2</sub> levels using the [Liquid N<sub>2</sub> Tank Level Log](Liquid_N2_Tank_Log.pdf).

2. No vacuum will last forever, so have the vessel tested by the manufacturer (Thermo Fisher) or a qualified cry-vessel service technician every 7-10 years.

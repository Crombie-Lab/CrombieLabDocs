# Parasite Culture

**Carry out all work in sterile BSC environment and maintain sterile technique.**

## *B. malayi*

| Culture Media Component    | Volume (for 50 mL total volume)        |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
|RPMI-1640                   |44 mL                                   |
|Pen-Strep (100 U/mL each)   |500 μL of 100X stock (10,000 U/mL each) |
|Gentamicin (0.4%) (Optional)|500 uL of 100X stock (0.4 mg/μL)        |
|FBS (heat-inactivated)      |5 mL                                    |

- Complete media can be stored at 4°C for up to two weeks

- Parasites will typically arrive in 15 mL or 50 mL conical tubes. Culture Adult parasites for at least 24 hr. prior to use to allow parasites to recover from shipment.

### Washing parasites and replacing media

1. Pellet parasites
    - Microfilariae (mf): spin in a benchtop centrifuge at 2000 x *g* for 15 min or follow the protocol in [cleaning mf]()
    - L3s: let settle for 30 min. at room temperature
    - Adults: should settle immediately

2. Remove all but ~10% of the conditioned media

3. Culture adults in 40 mL of media, L3s in 10 mL of media, and mf in 10 mL (< 1 million) or 30 mL (> 1 million)

4. Placed labeled tubes with loose caps in the 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator with humidity

5. Replace media every 24 hr.

## *D. immitis*

| Culture Media Component    | Volume (for 50 mL total volume)        |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
|RPMI-1640 (+ L-glutamine)   |43 mL                                   |
|Pen-Strep (100 U/mL each)   |500 μL of 100X stock (10,000 U/mL each) |
|HEPES (20 mM)               |500 uL of 2M stock                      |
|1% (w/v) D-glucose          |0.5 g                                   |
|1% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate |0.5 g                                   |
|FBS (heat-inactivated)      |5 mL                                    |

- Complete media can be stored at 4°C for up to two weeks
- Adust pH to 7.2 with NaOH
- Vacuum filter (0.22 μm) after adjusting pH
- *D. immitis* should be incubated in a 39°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator with humidity
- Adult *D. immitis* should be cultured in cell culture flasks (e.g. <a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/169900#/169900" target="_blank">ThermoFisher 169900</a> with loosened caps if unfiltered

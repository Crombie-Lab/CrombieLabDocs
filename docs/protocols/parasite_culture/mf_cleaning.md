# Microfilariae Cleaning and Concentration

**NOTE: While this protocol results in very pure mf, we regularly experience >50% loss - worms get stuck to the filter, so be sure to account for possible loss when planning experiments.**

## Materials

- Syringes (10 mL or 25 mL)

- <a href="https://shop.pall.com/us/en/laboratory/analytical-qc/instrumentation-spare-parts/25-mm-easy-pressure-syringe-filter-holder-delrin-plastic-zidgri78lzm/" target="_blank">25 mm syringe filter holders</a>

- [30 μm syringe filters]()

- <a href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/mm/tmtp02500?lang=en&region=US" target="_blank">5 μm syringe filters</a>

- Incomplete media with antibiotic

- 50 mL Falcon tubes

## Protocol

1. Upon receipt, push mf through a pre-wet 30 μm syringe filter into a 50 uL tube (this filters out debris).

2. Push the flow-through through a pre-wet 5 μm syringe filter into a glass  waste container. Do not force the media and worms through the filter, but use a new filter whenever you begin experiencing strong pressure against the syringe plunger.

3. Transfer the filter to a dish filled with 5-10 mL of warm incomplete media. Continue to add filters to the same dish.

4. Use a pasteur pipette to gently free the mf from the filters. **NOTE**: many worms will remain stuck to the filter and are unable to be removed.

5. Transfer clean mf to a 15 mL conical tube. Quantify mf by counting three 0.5 μL aliquots.

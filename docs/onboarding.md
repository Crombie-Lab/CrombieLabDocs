# Zamanian Lab Computational Environment

Zamanian lab academic staff will be expected to use macOS and maintain a local environment that is consistent across all lab machines. Follow [these instructions](osx.md) to create your environment.

Most tool development and analyses will incorporate version control with GitHub. Follow [these instructions](github.md) to create your account and join the `@zamanianlab` organization.

Many core pipelines will be performed on our BRC6 server. Instructions for server use can be found [here](server.md).

# Lab Storage Pipelines

Large data sets will be stored in locations with reliable backup (ResearchDrive). This includes all high-throughput sequencing and imaging data.

- UW ResearchDrive (Large Data)

    [ResearchDrive](https://it.wisc.edu/services/researchdrive) provides 5 TB (expandable) of secure backed-up storage. Lab members will have access to the lab ResearchDrive using their UW net-id and password. Our sequencing data from the BRC is automatically moved into ResearchDrive. We will also use ResearchDrive to store imaging and all other large data types. General instructions on how to connect to and transfer data in and out of ResearchDrive are provided [here](https://kb.wisc.edu/researchdata/internal/page.php?id=93998). Data will be transferred from ResearchDrive to the CHTC for pipeline-based processing. Outputs will be transferred from the CHTC back to ResearchDrive for long-term storage. Subsets of outputs will be transferred into our lab [Box](http://www.box.com) account for post-processing, analysis and plotting. Curent ResearchDrive directory structure is shown below:

    Instructions can be found for [connecting](https://kb.wisc.edu/researchdata/internal/page.php?id=93998#connect) to and [transferring](https://kb.wisc.edu/researchdata/internal/page.php?id=93998#transferdata) files in and out of ResearchDrive. Files can be transferred into the mounted ResearchDrive using a number of [approaches](https://kb.wisc.edu/researchdata/96641), including simple drag-and-drop or command-line `rsync` or `cp`.

    Example on a Mac OS X system:

      ```
      Finder > Go > "Connect to server... >
      smb://research.drive.wisc.edu/mzamanian

      rsync -rltv ~/Desktop/Data/[dir] /Volumes/mzamanian/ImageXpress/raw/
      ```

- BRC (UW Biotech Center)

    Sequencing data generated by the UW Biotechnology Center is delivered to their BRC servers. These data can be accessed in [numerous ways](https://www.biotech.wisc.edu/services/brc/data-access). Our sequencing data are auto-deposited into ResearchDrive and so directly accessing these files may not be necessary.

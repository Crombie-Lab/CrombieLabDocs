# Pipelines Overview and Tools

## Pipeline Organization

We organize our pipelines into 3 tiers, each of which be structured in slightly different ways. Pipelines are categorized into one of the following:

1.  [Local Pipelines](pipelines_local.md) (performed entirely locally)

    -   qPCR
    -   EPG
    -   Sensory assays

2.  [Core Server Pipelines](pipelines_server.md) (contain a remote server component)

    -   ImageXpress
    -   WormViz
    -   Tierpsy

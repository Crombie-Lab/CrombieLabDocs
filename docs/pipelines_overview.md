# Pipelines Overview and Tools

## Pipeline Organization

We organize our pipelines into two groups, structured in slightly different ways:

1.  [Local Pipelines](pipelines_local.md) (performed entirely locally)

    -   qPCR
    -   EPG
    -   Sensory assays

2.  [Core Pipelines](pipelines_server.md) (contain a remote server component)

    -   ImageXpress
    -   WormViz
    -   Tierpsy

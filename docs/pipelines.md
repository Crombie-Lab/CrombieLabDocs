# Lab Pipelines and Tools

## Pipeline Organization

We organize our pipelines into 3 tiers, each of which be structured in slightly different ways. Pipelines are categorized into one of the following:

1.  Core Pipelines (performed entirely on a server)

    -   ImageXpress

2.  Mixed Pipelines (performed using a mix of local machines and servers)

    -   WormViz
    -   Tierpsy

3.  [Simple Pipelines](simple.md) (performed entirely locally)

    -   qPCR
    -   EPG
    -   Sensory assays

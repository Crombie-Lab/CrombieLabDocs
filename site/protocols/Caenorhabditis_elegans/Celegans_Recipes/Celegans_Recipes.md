## 2x Worm Lysis Buffer (for genotyping worms)

| Reagent | Amount for 100 mL | Final Concentrations |
| ------- | :----------------------: | :-------------------: |
| KCl | 0.745 g | 100 mM |
| Tris (pH 8.0) | 0.24 g | 20 mM |
| MgCl<sub>2</sub> | 0.047 g | 5 mM |
| IGEPAL | 900 μL | 0.9% |
| Tween 20 | 900 μL | 0.9% |
| Gelatin | 20 mg | 0.02% |

NP40/Tween are detergents, in a liquid form, so the concentration is volume per volume. Because they are viscous and difficult to pipet accurately undiluted, the easiest method is to decant some into a (graduated) 10mL conical and add an equal amount of water to get a 50% stock; mix well, and this can be pipetted accurately. Leftover 50% detergent can be saved at room temperature for a long time.

Gelatin is a solid, so should be handled as weight per volume.

- Make 10 mL aliquots and store in the -20°C.

- Don't try to make a 50% stock of IGEPAL - just pipette directly and be patient.

**Just before use, add 20 μL 20 mg/mL proteinase K (in water, store in frozen aliquots) per mL of 2x lysis buffer.**
